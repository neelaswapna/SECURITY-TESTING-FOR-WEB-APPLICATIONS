##
The above code uses Selenium WebDriver for automating security testing in web applications. ChromeDriver is used to interact with the Chrome browser. The program tests for SQL Injection (SQLi) by injecting malicious SQL queries into login fields and checks if unauthorized access is granted. It also tests for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by injecting JavaScript payloads into input fields to see if scripts execute. In real-time, this approach is used in e-commerce, banking, and social media platforms to identify vulnerabilities in login forms, comment sections, and search bars, helping developers secure web applications against cyber threats.
